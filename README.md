# Address Book

## Introduction
This CRUD app is an address book which allows users to view, add, edit and delete contact information. It was developed using React JS, and utilizes a JSON server as the backend server. JSON Server is an easy-to-use module that allows you to quickly and conveniently mock or fake a REST API for development and testing purposes. It allows you to quickly create a backend server that can be used to simulate responses to requests, allowing you to develop and test your code without having to connect to a live server. This makes it especially useful for development, testing, and debugging applications. The UI is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy to find and modify contacts. All in all, this app provides an efficient and easy way of managing contact information.
