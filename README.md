# Address Book Web app

## Introduction
This a basic CRUD React Address Book web application made for a technical test given to me by a company based in the UK. The task was to build an address book web application, with all data stored in a JSON flat file. The objectives were to be able to list, view, add, edit and delete records, all of which I have obtained successfully. The web app uses json as the rest backend server.

##  How to install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IshmamDC217/AddressBook.git
cd AddressBook

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install
```

## How to run
Ensure you have NodeJS and npm installed in your system.

### Start the backend server
1. Start the backend server first:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```
This will run the backend server at localhost:9000

### Start the client
2. Open a separate terminal to start the client:

```bash
npm start
```

3. If/When it runs, the site can be opened directly using netlify as my web app has been successfully deployed over there. The link has been attached here:

However, best results of my web app can be achieved by running it locally.
