# Address Book

## Introduction
This a CRUD React Address Book web application made for a technical test given to me by a company based in the UK. The task was to build an address book web application, with all data stored in a JSON flat file. The objectives were to be able to list, view, add, edit and delete records, all of which I have obtained successfully. The web app uses json as the rest backend server.
